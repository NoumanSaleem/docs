# How to use this image

    docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -d wordpress

The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your WordPress instance:

 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked mysql container)
 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "wordpress")
 - `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT=...` (default to unique random SHA1s)

If the `WORDPRESS_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist in the given MySQL container,  it will be created automatically upon container startup, provided that the `WORDPRESS_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

    docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d wordpress

Then, access it via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

# Issues and Contributing

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

## Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch.

Update this documentation when creating or modifying features. Test your documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness.

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference to all the issues that they address.

Commit messages should start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars) written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the suggested modifications and force push amended commits to your feature branch. Be sure to post a comment after pushing. The changed commits will show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you comment.

Before the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash your commits into logical units of work using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. Include documentation changes in the same commit so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like Closes #XXXX or Fixes #XXXX, which will automatically close the issue when merged.
